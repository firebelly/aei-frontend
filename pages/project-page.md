headline: First of its kind energy system. 70% more efficient and cutting carbon by well over half.
intro: <p>As prime consultant and lead engineer, Affiliated Engineers analyzed energy production options, evaluated capital and operating costs, and assessed financial and energy risk through 2050, then designed and directed implementation of central components projected to be greatly more efficient and significantly less harmful than Stanford’s previous system.</p>

    html: <p>The Stanford Energy Center, designed for a peak load of 28,000 tons of cooling and 350 mmbtu/hr heating, replaces a combined heat and power system with heat recovery chillers that - along with standard chillers and gas-fired hot water generators - capitalize on daily heating and cooling overlap to heat the campus, and hospital with recovered energy. Two million gallons of hot water and ten million gallons of chilled water Thermal Energy Storage accommodate high demand periods.</p>

    html: <p>Portions of the facility are regulated by OSHPD. A new 80 MVA, N+1, 60kV-12.47 substation will allow flexible future management of Stanford’s energy supply platform. Conversion of nearly 200 campus buildings from steam to hot water includes district energy heat exchanger stations at each building and over 20 miles of a direct buried, highly insulated, low loss hot water piping system conforming to European Standard EN253. SESI became operational in 2015.</p>
